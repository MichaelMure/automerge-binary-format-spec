== Introduction

Automerge is a library that allows people to collaboratively work together
without a central co-ordination or a reliable connection.  It is a specific
implementation of of a conflict-free replicated data type (or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conflict-free_replicated_data_type[CRDT]).

This document describes the storage format used when serializing Automerge
documents and changes for storage or transfer.

We strongly encourage people to use a library based on the reference
implementation https://github.com/automerge/automerge-rs[automerge-rs] (which is
available as a
https://github.com/automerge/automerge-rs/tree/main/rust/automerge-c[C shared
library] or a
https://github.com/automerge/automerge-rs/tree/main/rust/automerge-wasm[WebAssembly module] for ease of integration). That said, this document should let
you get started building your own, or at least understanding how Automerge
works.

The storage format is designed for compactness and speed of parsing. Automerge 
stores the full history of changes to the document: this is a large amount of
data but in practice it is very repetitive and amenable to compression.

In addition to parsing the storage format, an Automerge library must resolve
conflicts between concurrent operations in a consistent way. This document does
not yet discuss how to do that (pull requests welcome :D), but the reference
implementation should serve as a guide.

== Terminology and Conventions

The key words "`MUST`", "`MUST NOT`", "`REQUIRED`", "`SHALL`", "`SHALL NOT`",
"`SHOULD`", "`SHOULD NOT`", "`RECOMMENDED`", "`NOT RECOMMENDED`", "`MAY`", and
"`OPTIONAL`" in this document are to be interpreted as described in <<RFC2119>>
and <<RFC8174>> when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as
shown here.


== Concepts

=== Document

An Automerge document is a collaboratively editable JSON-like structure. The
serialized form of a document contains complete history of changes and
operations that collaborators have applied.

Automerge documents have a root value that is a map from string keys to arbitrary
<<Value,values>>.

=== Change

A change is a group of <<Operation,operations>> that modify a <<Document,document>>,
analagous to a "commit" in a version control system like git.

Each change is made by an <<Actor,actor>>, and has a (possibly empty) set of 
predecessor changes. Changes have an optional wall-clock timestamp, to keep
track of when a change was committed, and an optional message to describe
meaningful changes.

A change is identified by its <<Change Hash,change hash>> which is the
<<SHA256>> hash of the binary representation of the change.

=== Actor

An actor makes applies a linear sequence of <<Operation,operations>> to a <<Document,document>>
and commits them in a sequence of <<Change,changes>>. Each actor has an actor ID that
uniquely identifies it. An actor ID is an arbitrary sequence of bytes, which
should be generated in a way that will not collide with other actors (the reference
library generates 128-bit random identifiers).

There is a small amount of per-actor overhead, so if you have one process that
edits a document several times sequentially, it is preferrable to re-use the
same actor ID for each change.

=== Operation

An operation is an individual mutation made by an <<Actor,actor>> to a <<Document,document>>.
For example, setting a key to a value or inserting a character into some text.

An operation has an <<Action,action>> which identifies what it does, and various
fields depending on which action. For example a `"set"` operation has to
identify the object being modified, the key in that object, and the new value.

Each operation is identified by an operation ID. An operation ID is a pair
of (<<Actor,actor ID>>, counter), where the counter is a unique always-incrementing
value per actor.

=== Object

An object represents a collaboratively editable value in an Automerge document. There are three kinds
of object:

* `map` which maps string keys to <<Value,values>>,
* `list` which is an ordered list of values
* `text` which is a collaboratively editable utf-8 string.

Each object is created by an operation with an `action` of `"makeMap"`,
`"makeList"` or `"makeText"`, and is identified by its object ID. The object ID
is the <<Operation,operation ID>> of the operation that created the object.

Each document has a root `map` which is identified by the object ID with a
`null` actor id and `null` counter.

=== Value

Automerge objects are dynamically typed, and can contain any of the following kinds of value:

* `map`, `list`, `text` – the collaboratively editable <<Object,objects>>
* `null` - an typed null
* `bool` - either `true` or `false`
* `float` - a 64-bit IEEE754 float
* `int` - a 64-bit signed int
* `uint` – a 64-bit unsigned int
* `string` - a utf-8 encoding string (possibly containing U+0000)
* `bytes` - an arbitrary sequence of bytes
* `timestamp` - a 64-bit signed integer representing milliseconds since the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time[unix epoch]
* `counter` - a 64-bit signed intenger that collaborators increment or decrement (instead of overwriting)

== File structure

An Automerge file consists of one or more length delimited chunks.
Implementations must attempt to read chunks until the end of the file.

[#chunk-containers]
=== Chunks

[bytefield, target="chunk-container"]
....
(defattrs :vertical [:plain {:writing-mode "vertical-rl"}])
(def row-height 120)
(draw-column-headers)
(draw-box "magic" {:span 4})
(draw-box "checksum" {:span 4})
(draw-box (text "block type" :vertical))
(draw-box (text "chunk length" :vertical) {:borders #{:left :top :bottom}})
(draw-gap-inline)
(draw-gap "chunk contents")
(draw-bottom)
....

|===
| Field                   | Byte Length         | Description

| Magic bytes             | 4                   | The sequence `[0x85, 0x6f, 0x4a, 0x83]`
| Checksum            | 4                   | Validates the integrity of the chunk
| <<Chunk Type,Chunk type>>          | 1                   | The type of this chunk
| Chunk length            | Variable (64-bit <<uLEB>>) | The length of the following chunk bytes
| Chunk contents          | Variable        | The actual bytes for the chunk
|===

If the first four bytes are not exactly the magic bytes implementations MUST abort.

The checksum is the first four bytes of the <<SHA256>> hash of the concatenation
of the chunk type, chunk length and chunk contents fields. Implementations MUST
abort reading if the checksum does not match.

==== Chunk Type
The chunk type is either:

|===
| Value | Type | Description
| `0x00` | <<Document Chunk,Document chunk>> | Contains a graph of related changes
| `0x01` | <<Change Chunk,Change chunk>> | Contains a single change and its operations
| `0x02` | <<Compressed Change Chunk,Compressed change chunk>> | Contains a single change deflate compressed
|===

[#document-chunks]
==== Document Chunk

The fields in a document chunk, in order, are:

|===
| Field                                       | Type            | Description                                       

| Actors                                      | <<Array of Actor IDs>>        | The actor IDs in sorted order                     
| Heads                                       | <<Array of Change Hashes>>    | The hashes of the change graph in sorted order 
| Change columns metadata                     | <<Column Metadata>>  | Description of the <<Change Columns,change columns>>
| Operation columns metadata                  | <<Column Metadata>>  | Description of the <<Operation Columns,operation columns>>
| Change columns                              | <<Column Data>>      | The actual bytes for the change columns
| Operation columns                           | <<Column Data>>      | The actual bytes for the operation columns
| Heads index                                | <<Heads Index>>     | A lookup from change hash to change
|===

A document contains a set of changes that represent the history of a
collaboratively edited document. A document always contains a complete history
of changes: for each change in the document, all the changes that were made to
the document before that change was made are also included.

Document chunks use a columnar storage format for both changes and operations
that assumes that the values of various fields are similar across adjacent
changes and operations to optimize for high compression ratios and fast
decoding.

Most fields are of arbitrary length, so parsing the document must proceed in
order; for example it is not possible to know the length of the column fields
until the column metadata has been parsed.

By implication, a document with no changes consists of `0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00`, as
the counts of actors, heads, change columns and operations columns are all zero.
With the chunk header, this gives a file consisting of the following bytes:
`0x85 0x6f 0x4a 0x83 0xb8 0x1a 0x95 0x44 0x00 0x04 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x00`.

[#change-chunks]
==== Change Chunk

The fields in a change chunk, in order, are:

|===
| Field | Type | Description

| Dependencies | <<Array of Change Hashes>> | The set of changes that this change depends on
| Actor length | 64-bit <<uLEB>> | The length of the actor ID
| Actor | bytes | The <<Actor,actor ID>>
| Sequence number | 64-bit <<uLEB>> | The sequence number
| Start op | 64-bit <<uLEB>> | The counter of the first op in this change 
| Time | 64-bit <<LEB>> | The time this change was created in milliseconds since the unix epoch
| Message length | 64-bit <<uLEB>> | The length of the message in bytes
| Message | UTF-8 encoded string | The message associated with this change
| Other actors | <<Array of Actor IDs>> | Other actor IDs in this change
| Operation columns metadata | <<Column Metadata>> | Description of the <<Operation Columns,operation columns>>
| Operation columns | <<Column Data>> | The actual bytes for the operation columns
| Extra bytes | bytes | All data remaining in the chunk
|===

A change chunk just contains a single change, its metadata and operations. It
does not include any dependent changes, so you can only apply the change to a
document that already contains those dependent changes.

Change chunks use a columnar storage format that assumes that the values of
various fields are similar across adjacent operations to optimize for high
compression ratios and fast decoding.

The extra bytes must be retained when processing changes. If future versions of
automerge add new metadata to changes, this will allow old clients to
collaborate with new clients without limiting which features the new clients can
use.

[#compressed-chunks]
==== Compressed Change Chunk

A compressed change chunk is a change chunk where the contents have been
compressed using <<DEFLATE>>. The checksum of a compressed chunk is calculated
as through the chunk was not compressed (with type = 1, the length of the
uncompressed data, and the original uncompressed data).

For example if you have a change which has 372 bytes of data (excluding the header) which compresses to 323 bytes.
If the original change chunk header consisted of the following bytes:
`0x85 0x6f 0x4a 0x83 0x80 0xb7 0x5d 0x54 0x01 0xf4 0x02`,
the compressed change chunk header would consist of:
`0x85 0x6f 0x4a 0x83 0x80 0xb7 0x5d 0x54 0x02 0xc3 0x02`

To decode a compressed change chunk first decompress the chunk contents, and
then construct a new chunk with the same magic bytes and checksum, but with type
= 1 and the length of the decompressed data. Then parse that as a change chunk.

=== Simple types

==== uLEB

uLEB is an unsigned https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128[little endian base 128] value.
This is a variable length encoding used throughout.

To encode a uLEB, represent the number in binary and pad it with leading zeros
so that it has a length which is a multiple of 7. Take each group of 7 bytes from
least-significant to most-significant and output them in bytes - the first bit
of every byte is 1 except for the last byte which is 0.

* Unsigned ints 0 - 127 are stored as one byte: `0b00000000 - 0b01111111`
* Unsigned ints 128 - 16383 are stored as two bytes: `0b10000000 0b00000001 - 0b11111111 0b01111111`
etc.

To decode a uLEB, read bytes up to and including the first byte with a 0 as the
first bit.  Take the latter 7 bits from each byte (the last byte contains the
most significant bits, so you need to concatenate them in the opposite order to
which the bytes are represented on disk).

Although uLEB encoding can support numbers of arbitrary bitsize, unsigned
integers in Automerge must not exceed 64 bits. Implementations should fail to
parse documents with uLEBs that decode to a value too large to be represented in
a 64-bit unsigned integer.

Implementations must generate the shortest possible uLEB encodings, and should
reject documents with overly long encodings. For example using the decoding
rules above the bytes `0b10000000 0b00000000` would be decoded as 0; but this is
overly long: 0 can be represented in just one byte as `0b00000000`, so should be
rejected.

==== LEB

LEB is a signed variant https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LEB128[little endian base 128] value

To encode a uLEB, represent the number in twos complement, and sign-extend it so
that it has a length which is a multiple of seven. If the number is negative the padding will
be of 1-bits and if the number is positive the padding will be 0-bits.

* 0 is represented as one byte: `0b0000000`
* Ints from 1 to 63 are represented as one byte: `0b00000001 - 0b00111111`
* Ints from -1 to -64 are represented as one byte: `0b01111111 - 0b010000000`
* Ints from 64 to 8191 are represented as two bytes: `0b11000000 0b00000000 - 0b11111111 0b00111111`
* Ints from -65 to -8192 are represented as two bytes: `0b10111111 0b01111111 - 0b10000000 0b01000000`
etc.

To decode an LEB, read bytes up to and including the first byte with a 0 as the
first bit.  Take the latter 7 bits from each byte (the last byte contains the
most signfiicant bits, so you need to concatenate them in the opposite order to
which the bytes are represented on disk). If the first bit of your number is 1
(from the second bit of the last byte in encoded form) then you have a negative
number and you can take twos complement to get to its absolute value; otherwise
you have a positive number (or 0).

Although LEB encoding can support numbers of arbitrary bitsize, signed
integers in Automerge must not exceed 64 bits. Implementations should fail to
parse documents with uLEBs that decode to a value too large to be represented in
a 64-bit signed integer.

Implementations must generate the shortest possible LEB for a given integer, and
should reject documents with overly long encodings.  For example the decoding
rules above the bytes `0b11111111 0b01111111` would be decoded as -1; but this
is overly long: -1 can be represented as just one byte `0b01000000`, so should
be rejected.

==== Change Hash

A change hash is the 32-byte <<SHA256>> hash of the concatenation of the chunk
type (0x01) chunk length and chunk contents fields of a change represented as a
<<Change Chunk,change chunk>>.

The first four bytes of the change hash are used as a checksum when a change
chunk is serialized.

==== Action

The actions of the reference data model are encoded in the storage format as a
byte as follows:

|===
| Byte | Action      | Description

| 0x00 | `makeMap`   | Creates a new map object
| 0x01 | `set`       | Sets a key of a map, overwrites an item in a list, inserts an item in a list, or edits text
| 0x02 | `makeList`  | Creates a new list object
| 0x03 | `del`       | Unsets a key of a map, or removes an item from a list (reducing its length)
| 0x04 | `makeText`  | Creates a new text object
| 0x05 | `inc`       | Increments a counter stored in a map or a list
|===

Future versions of automerge may add new actions, and implementations must
preserve operations containing actions they don't support when processing
changes for forward compatibility.

==== Column Specification

Column specifications are a 32-bit <<uLEB>> interpreted as a bitfield:

[bytefield,target="column-id-layout"]
....
(def boxes-per-row 32)
(def row-height 100)
(defattrs :vertical [:plain {:writing-mode "vertical-rl"}])
(draw-column-headers {:labels (map str (reverse (take 32 (iterate inc 1))))})
(draw-box "ID" {:span 28})
(draw-box (text "DEFLATE" :vertical) {:span 1})
(draw-box "type" {:span 3})
....

* The least significant three bits encode the column type
* The 4th least significant bit is `1` if the column is <<DEFLATE>> compressed and
  `0` otherwise
* The remaining bits are the column ID

If the deflate bit is set then the column data must first be decompressed using
DEFLATE before proceeding with decoding the values.

The DEFLATE bit is only permitted in <<Document Chunk,document chunks>>,
implementations must abort if they find compressed columns in
<<change-chunks,change chunks>>.

The ID defines the purpose of the column for either <<Change Columns>> or
<<Operation Columns>>, and implementations must preserve columns that they do
not understand.

The column type specifies how the data in the column is encoded. The possible
types are:

[#column-types-table]
|===
| Value | Description

| 0 | <<Group Column>>
| 1 | <<Actor Column>>
| 2 | <<uLEB Column>>
| 3 | <<Delta Column>>
| 4 | <<Boolean Column>>
| 5 | <<String Column>>
| 6 | <<Value Metadata Column>>
| 7 | <<Value Column>>
|===

=== Compound types

==== Array of Actor IDs

The actor ID array consists of a 64-bit <<uLEB>> giving the count of actor ids, followed by 
each actor ID as a length-prefixed byte array.

Each item in the array consists of a 64-bit <<uLEB>> giving the length in bytes,
and then that number of bytes.

For example an array consisting of the single actor ID `[0xab, 0xcd, 0xef]`
would be encoded as: `0x01 0x03 0xab 0xcd 0xef`.

Implementations must store actor ids lexicographically, and should error when
reading a document with actor ids in the wrong order.

==== Array of Change Hashes

The heads array consists of a 64-bit <<uLEB>> N giving the count of heads,
followed by N <<Change Hash,change hashes>> each exactly 32-bytes long.

For example an array consisting of the heads
`f986a4318d1f1cc0e2e10e421e7a9a4cd0b70a89dae98bc1d76d789c2bf7904c` and
`4355a46b19d348dc2f57c046f8ef63d4538ebb936000f3c9ee954a27460dd865` would be
represented as `0x02 0xf9 0x86 ..{28 bytes elided).. 0x90 0x4c 0x43 0x55 ..{28 bytes elided}.. 0xd8 0x65`

==== Heads Index

The heads index provides a lookup table from the change hash to the change in a
document. Very old automerge documents may be missing this field.

The index consists of N 64-bit <<uLEB>>'s (one per head in the Heads array of the
<<Document Chunk,document chunk>>), and each uLEB gives the index of that head's change
in the columnar change storage.

In a well-formed document, the <<Change Hash,change hash>> of the change
indicated will match the change hash in the heads array, but implementations may
chose to not validate this when parsing documents to avoid having to recompute
every change hash.

==== Column Metadata

The column metadata consists of a 64-bit <<uLEB>> N giving the number of
columns, followed by N pairs describing each columns in the chunks <<Column Data, column data>>.

|===
| Field | Description

| Column Specification | a 32-bit <<uLEB>> encoded <<Column Specification>>
| Column Length | 64-bit <<uLEB>> of the length (in bytes) of the column data
block 
|===

The column specifications must be unique and sorted. Implementations must not
include both an uncompressed and a compressed column with the same ID and type,
and the column order should be sorted with the deflate bit set to 0.

A column that contains only null values, or is otherwise empty, should be
omitted from the chunk. In this case there will be no column specification in
the column metadata and no data in the column data.

In the case that there are no changes or operations at all, then the column
metadata will be encoded as `0x00` to indicate that there are no columns at all,
and there will be no column data in the chunk.

=== Column Data

Columns are stored one after the other with no separators or length indicators.
The columns are stored in order they appear in the <<Column Metadata,column metadata>>
and each can be decoded according to its <<Column Specification,column specification>>.

All columns must have the same number of items (or the same number of arrays of
items for grouped columns), though as they are compressed
differently they may have vastly different byte counts.

For future compatibility it is important that programs which edit Automerge
documents maintain all columns, even those that they don't understand the
meaning of. When new changes or operations are added to a document with an
<<unknown-columns,unknown column>> a null should be added following the encoding
rules of its <<Column Specification,specification>>.

==== Change Columns

The currently defined columns for changes in a <<Document Chunk,document chunk>> are:

|===
| Name | Specification | ID | Type | Description

| actor | 1 | 0 | <<Actor Column>> | The actor that made the change
| sequence number | 3 | 0 | <<Delta Column>> | The sequence number for each change
| maxOp | 19 | 1 | <<Delta Column>> | The largest counter that occurs in each change
| time | 35 | 2 |<<Delta Column>> | The (optional) wallclock time at which each change was made
| message | 53 | 2 | <<String Column>> | The (optional) commit message for each change
| dependencies group | 64 | 4 | <<Group Column>> | The number of dependencies for each change
| dependencies index | 67 | 4 | Grouped <<Delta Column>> | The indices of the changes this change depends on
| extra metadata | 86 | 5 |<<Value Metadata Column>> | The metadata for any extra data for this change
| extra data | 87 | 5 | <<Value Column>> | Any extra data for this change
|===

Each value in the `dependencies index` column is an index into the changes that
are stored in the document's columns.  Implementations MUST abort if an index is
out of bounds.

The `sequence number` of a change should be `1` if it is the first change by a
given actor.  Each subsequent change must have a sequence number exactly `1`
higher than the previous change by the same actor.  Implementations MUST abort
if there are missing changes for a given actor ID.

The `maxOp` field of the change refers to the largest counter component of an
operation ID in the set of operations in this change. For a given actor ID this
must always increase. Implementations MUST abort if the `maxOp` of a change is
not larger than all the `maxOp` of changes from that actor with smaller `seq`.

After decoding all the columns, and de-referencing indices into other columns,
you will have an array of changes, where each change conceptually has the
following fields:

|===
| Field | Type | Mapping

| actor ID | array of bytes | The id of the actor that made the change
| seq | 64-bit uint | The sequence number of the change
| ops | array of <<Operation, operations>> | The operations for this change (take all operations with counter greater the previous change's maxOp and less than or equal to this change's maxOp)
| deps | array of <<Change, changes>> | The changes this change depends on (look up each index in the dependencies index in this documents changes columns)
| time | 64-bit int | The (optional) wallclock time of the change
| message | utf-8 string | The (optional) message of the change
| extra data | any | The (optional) extra data (parse the extra data column according to the extra metadata column)
|===

==== Operation Columns

The currently defined columns for operations are:

|===
| Field | Specification | ID | Type | Description
 
| object actor ID | 1 | 0 | <<Actor Column>> | actor index of object ID each operation targets
| object counter | 2 | 0 | <<uLEB Column>> | counter of the object ID each operation targets
| key actor ID | 17 | 1 |<<Actor Column>> | actor of the operation ID of the key of each operation
| key counter | 19 | 1 | <<uLEB Column>> | counter of the operation ID of the key of each
  operation
| key string | 21 | 1 | <<String Column>> | The string key each operation targets
| actor ID | 33 | 2 | <<Actor Column>> | The actor of each operations ID
| counter | 35 | 2 | <<Delta Column>> | The counter of each operations ID
| insert | 52 | 3 | <<Boolean Column>> | Whether or not this is an insert operation
| action | 66 | 4 | <<uLEB Column>> | The <<Action>> of each operation
| value metadata | 86 | 5 | <<Value Metadata Column>> | The metadata for the value of this operation
| value | 87 | 5 | <<Value Column>> | The value of this operation
| predecessor group | 112 | 6 |<<Group Column>> | The group for the predecessors of this operation (only in <<change-chunks,change chunks>>)
| predecessor actor IDs |113 | 6 | Grouped <<Actor Column>> | The actor ID of each predecessor's operation ID
| predecessor counters |115 | 6 | Grouped <<Delta Column>> | The counter of each predecessor's operation ID
| successor group | 128 | 8 | <<Group Column>> | The group for the successors of this operation (only in <<Document Chunk,document chunks>>)
| successor actor IDs | 129 | 8 | Grouped <<Actor Column>> | The actor ID of each successor's operation ID
| successor counters | 131 | 8 | Grouped <<Delta Column>> | The counter of each successor's operation ID
|===

WARNING: The javascript implementation includes a `child` column, is this
required?

We determine the key that the operation refers to thusly:

* If the key string is not null then this is the key of the operation (when modifying a <<Object,map>>).
* Otherwise we use the pair (lookup_actor(key actor ID), key counter) as the key of the operation (when modifying a <<Object,list>>).
* If key string is null and any of key actor or key counter are null implementations MUST abort

Operations are stored with their predecessors in <<change-chunks,change chunks>> and with successors
in <<Document Chunk, document chunks>>. For more information see the section
on <<Implementation concerns,implementation concerns>>.

After decoding all the columns, and de-referencing indices into other columns,
you will have an array of operations, where each operation conceptually has the
following fields:

|===
| Field | Type | Mapping to columns
| Object | Object ID | The object modified by this operation in (column 0)
| Key | String or Operation ID | The position in that object to modify (column 1)
| ID | Operation ID | The ID of this operation, and thus the object ID of any <<Object,object>> it creates (column 2)
| Insert | boolean | For operations on `list` or `text` objects, whether to overwrite the position (when `false`) or insert before the position (when `true`)
| <<Action>> | action | The action this operation takes
| <<Value>> | primitive value | The value inserted by this operation (if needed)

=== Column Types


==== Run Length Encoding

Many columns use run length encoding to compress repeated values. Such columns are
encoded as repeated pairs of the form `(length, value)`.

A "run" in an RLE columns is encoded as pairs of the form `(length,value)`.
`length` is a signed <<LEB>>:

* If `length` is positive, then `value` is a single instance of the value which
  occurs `length` times.
* If `length` is 0 then this pair represents a `null` value and `value` is the
  <<uLEB>> encoding of the number of times `null` occurs
* If `length` is negative then `value` is a literal run and the absolute value
  of `length` is the number of items in the literal run. That is to say, there
  is no compression.

For example if you were trying to compress the array of uLEBs `[0,0,0,null,null,1,2,3]`
you would encode it as `0x03 0x00 0x00 0x02 0x7d 0x01 0x02 0x03`

[#group-columns]
==== Group Column

Some fields in automerge have multiple values per change or operation. An
example of this is the dependencies index of a <<Change Columns,change>>. The
group column (denoted by column type 0) defines how many values should be read from each grouped column
when parsing each change or operation.

Grouping affects all columns with the same ID as its <<Column Specification,column specification>>,
so a group column will usually be followed by one or more columns with the same
id but different types. It is possible to have a group column with no matching
grouped columns if the grouped column is completely empty, as it will be
omitted.

The group column is a <<Run Length Encoding,run length encoded>> list of 64-bit
<<uLEB>>s that specifies how many items should be read from the subsequent
grouped columns per change or operation. Implementations MUST abort if they
cannot read the correct number of values from each of the grouped columns.

For example if you had five changes in a document with `[0,1,2,2,2]`
dependencies each, the group column would be encoded as `0x7e 0x00 0x01 0x03
0x02`, and the dependencies index column would contain seven values.

Note that it is not possible for two columns in a group to have the same type as
it would not be possible to have a deterministic ordering for the column
specifications. Implementations MUST abort if they encounter two column
specifications with the same type and column ID.

Implementations MUST abort if they encounter multiple group column
specifications with the same ID.

[#actor-index-columns]
==== Actor Column

An actor column (denoted by column type 1) uses <<Run Length Encoding,run length encoding>> to compress a list of <<uLEB>>s
that represent an index into an array of actor ids.

In a <<Document Chunk,document chunk>> the index is the position of the actor id in the <<Array of Actor IDs,array of actor IDs>>.

In a <<Change Chunk,change chunk>> index 0 represents the actor id of the change, and index 1+ are given to the
other actor ids in the order they appear.

==== uLEB Column

A uLEB column (denoted by column type 2) uses <<Run Length Encoding,run length
encoding>> to compress a list of 64-bit <<uLEB>>s.

It is used (instead of a <<Delta Column,delta column>>) when there is no
expectation that delta compression would help reduce the storage requirement,
or if the column may contain null values.

==== Delta Column

A delta column (denoted by column type 3) uses <<Run Length Encoding,run length
encoding>> to compress a list of 64-bit <<uLEB>>s.

The sequence is assumed to start from zero, so if you wanted to encode the list
[3,4,5,6,9,7,8] you would first calculate the list of deltas
[+3,+1,+1,+1,+3,-2,+1], and then <<Run Length Encoding,run length encode>> the resulting signed <<LEB>>s to get the bytes
`0x7f 0x03 0x03 0x01 0x7d 0x03 0x7e 0x01`.

WARNING: How should applications handle a decoded delta value which takes the
absolute value below zero?

==== Boolean Column

A boolean column (denoted by column type 4) encodes a list of booleans. The column contains sequences of
64-bit <<uLEB>> integers which represent the lengths of alternating sequences of
`false/true`. The initial value of the column is always `false`

For example if you wanted to encode the list  `[true, true, false, false,
false]`, you would end up with a list of lengths of `[0,2,3]`, which would be
encoded as `0x00 0x02 0x03`.

==== String Column

A string column (denoted by column type 5) uses <<Run Length Encoding,run length
encoding>> to compress a list of length-prefixed UTF-8 strings. Each string is
encoded as a 64-bit <<uLEB>> followed by that many literal bytes.

For example, if you wanted to encode the list `["a", "", null, "boo", "boo"]`
you would end up with `0x7e 0x01 0x65 0x00 0x00 0x01 0x02 0x03 0x66 0x6f 0x6f`.


[#raw-value-columns]
==== Value Metadata Column

The value metadata column (denoted by column type 6) is always paired with a
<<Value Column,value column>> with the same ID. The metadata column is a <<Run Length Encoding, run length encoded>>
list of 64-bit <<LEB>>s that defines the type and length of each value in the
value column.

These integers are laid out like so:

[bytefield,target="raw-value-metadata-layout"]
....
(defattrs :vertical [:plain {:writing-mode "vertical-rl"}])
(draw-column-headers {:labels ["64", "63", "62", "61" ,"60", "59","58","57","56","...","6","5","4","3","2","1"] } )
(draw-box "length" {:span 12})
(draw-box "type" {:span 4})
....

* The lower four bits encode the type of the value
* The higher bits encode the length of the value

The type code may be 

|===
| Value | Type | Representation of value

| 0 | Null | Not present (length = 0)
| 1 | False | Not present (length = 0)
| 2 | True | Not present (length = 0)
| 3 | Unsigned integer | 64-bit <<uLEB>> in value column (length = 1..10)
| 4 | Signed integer | 64-bit <<LEB>> in value column (length = 1..10)
| 5 | IEEE754 float | 64-bit IEEE754 float in value column (length = 8) 
| 6 | UTF8 string | Utf-8 string in value column (length = 0..2^60)
| 7 | Bytes | Arbitrary bytes in value column (length = 0..2^60)
| 8 | Counter | 64-bit <<LEB>> in value column (length = 1..10)
| 9 | Timestamp | 64-bit <<LEB>> in value column (length = 1..10)
|===

If the type tag is none of these values it may be a value produced by a future
version of Automerge. In this case implementations MUST read and store the type
code and `length` bytes when reading and write them back in same position when
writing.

If the bytes in a UTF8 string value (type 6) are not valid utf-8, then implementations
should replace them by the unicode replacement character (U+FFFD).

WARNING: Replacing invalid utf-8 seems like it might be a bad idea? Should check
this. I _think_ it's what the javascript implementation does though.

==== Value Column

The value column (denoted by column type 7) contains raw <<Value,values>>. The
type and length of each value in the column is determined by the <<Value Metadata Column,value metadata column>>
with the same column ID.

Note that raw value columns which do not contain values may be omitted. If
implementations encounter a lone value metadata column they must assume that it
is accompanied by an empty raw value column.

Implementations must abort if they encounter  a raw value column not preceeded
by a metadata column with the same id. Implementations must also abort if they
encounter more than one metadata column with the same column id, or more than
one raw value column with the same id.

[#unknown-columns]
==== Unknown columns

When reading the column metadata applications may encounter column
specifications which they are not expecting. These column specifications may be
produced by future versions of the application. If an implementation encounters
an unknown column whilst reading data it MUST retain this data when writing that
data back to storage.

This is possible because every column type has some concept of a null value.
When inserting new rows into a collection of rows stored in the columnar storage
format application MUST write a null value into columns which they do not
recognise for the new rows they are inserting.

WARNING: What should the null value be for boolean or delta columns?

== Implementation concerns

Below are some notes that may help implementors build compatible automerge
implementations. They are likely not yet complete, and any differences between
what is written here and the https://github.com/Automerge/Automerge-rs[reference implementation]
should be resolved in favor of that.

=== Operations in document chunks

==== Ordering of operations

Operations are grouped by the object that they manipulate. Objects are then
sorted by their IDs. Thus operations are ordered using the following procedure:

WARNING: Is this required? If so should implementations abort if the operations
are not inthis order?

* First sort by object ID, such that any operations for the same object are
  consecutive. The null objectId (i.e. the root object) is sorted before all
  non-null objectIds. Non-null objectIds are sorted by <<Lamport Timestamps,
  Lamport timestamp>>.
* For each object:
** if the object is a map, sort the operations within that object
   lexicographically by key, so that all operations for the same key are
   consecutive. This sort order MUST be based on the UTF-8 byte sequence of the
   key. 
** If the object is a list or text, sort the operations within that object by the
   operation ID of the element they target. This is determined as follows:
*** For insert operations the target element is the operation ID of the
    inserting operation
*** For `set` or `delete` operations the target is the operation ID in the `key`
    field
* Among the operations for the same key (for maps) or the same list element (for
  lists/text), sort the operations by their opId, using <<Lamport Timestamps,
  lamport timestamp>> ordering. For list elements, note that the operation that
  inserted the operation will always have an opId that is lower than the opId of
  any operations that updates or deletes that list element, and therefore the
  insertion operation will always be the first operation for a given list
  element.


WARNING: the JavaScript implementation currently does not do this sorting
correctly, since it sorts keys by JavaScript string comparison, which differs
from UTF-8 lexicographic ordering for characters beyond the basic multilingual
plane.

==== Successors and omitting deletes

The document storage format does not encode a predecessors field. Instead this
information is encoded in the `successors` field. This can be used to
reconstruct the predecessors field from the reference data model.

Delete operations do not carry any information other than the object ID and key
they are deleting. As such they are encoded in the document by appending the
operation ID of the delete operation to the successors of the operation creating
the data to be deleted.

Implementations MUST abort if they encounter explicitly encoded delete
operations in a document chunk.

==== Calculating predecessors

Operations in the document format are not stored in the order they were
generated, as they are in the change data model. Furthermore, operations in the
document format have a `successor` rather than `predecessor` field. The
following procedure specifies how to map from document operations to the change
operations.

First expand operations:

* Add an empty predecessor list to every document operation
* For each operation in the document operation rows
** For each operation ID in the successors list of the document operation lookup
   the target operation in the document operations:
*** If an operation is found add the current operation ID to the
    target operations predecessor list
*** If no operation is found then insert a new delete operation into the
    document with its ID set to the target operation ID, the object and key
    set to the same value as the current operation, and the predecessor set to
    the current operation.

Second, match up changes:

For each document operation

* Sort all the changes for the same actor as the operation ID by ascending
  `maxOp`
* Add the document operation to the first change which has `maxOp >= counter`
  where `counter` is the counter component of the operation ID.

Implementations MUST abort if no matching change is found

For each change sort the operations within the change by
<<Lamport Timestamps, lamport timestamp>> of the operation ID.

=== Lamport Timestamps

Operation IDs are lamport timestamps. This imposes a total ordering. To compare two lamport timestamps:

* If the counter components are different then whichever timestamp has the larger counter is the larger
* If the counter components are the same but the actor IDs are different then the actor ID which is lexicographically larger is considered the larger timestamp
* Otherwise the two timestamps are equal

=== Hash verification

The dependencies in the document model are expressed as integer offsets. But in
the reference data model dependencies are expressed as a hash of the ancestor
changes. To map to the hash based representation perform a topological traversal
of the dependency graph and for each change serialize the change as a <<change-chunks, Change Chunk>>
then calculate the hash of the change as in the <<Change Hash>>, then for every
change replace the index of the current change with the calculated hash.

Once this procedure is complete take the heads of the depedency graph and
compare their hashes with the head hashes field in the document chunk. If the
hashes don't match implementations MUST abort.
